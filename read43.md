    * It is necessary to engage the management in the five whys process in the company.
    * Use paper or whiteboard instead of computers.
    * Write down the problem and make sure that all people understand it.
    * Distinguish causes from symptoms.
    * Pay attention to the logic of cause-and-effect relationship.
    * Make sure that root causes certainly led to the mistake by reversing the sentences created as a result of the analysis with the use of the expression "and therefore".
    * Try to make answers more precise.
    * Look for the cause step by step. Don't jump to conclusions.
    * Base our statements on facts and knowledge.
    * Assess the process, not people.
    * Never leave "human error", "worker's inattention", "blame John", etc. as the root cause.
    * Foster an atmosphere of trust and sincerity.
    * Ask the question "Why?" until the root cause is determined, i.e. the cause the elimination of which will prevent the error from occurring again.[10]
    * When you form the answer to the question "Why?" it should be from the customer's point of view.
