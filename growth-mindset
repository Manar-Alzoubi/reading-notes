## Upgrading  technical skills 

**In order to upgrade our technical skills we should solve more and more difficult programms, and some training for those problem, and finally you will find a reward of that**
 **otherwise we can not improve our skills**
 **the time that you spent in the past and you spend now will make your knowledge, every time you faced an error and recover it you are learn a new thing **
 **even if you spen many hours at the beggining every time this will be decreased until you just look to the code and you can fix it**
 *here we need to go to a concept of "deliberate practice" which we can summerize as: **
   * Activities that teacher designed to improve your coding.



## The Ideas of deliberate practice:

    * let you lave the comfort zone and do your work.
    * let you use mental thinking.
    * It requires good goals inorder to its difficulty

* No one can help you to start improving your self except yourself, no one can know your needs in programming and coding, just you can do
* and you can not solve a big problem without knowing the basics of problem solving, so at the same step when you learn basics you should practice them 
* more and more times, with running the code we can know if we are in the correct way or not according to the output of the code, and we can say if 
* you are mentally exhausted after solving a problem technicaly that means you are improved your skills.

* choose challenges that you will learn when you solve it not just determine in the result*
    > *Matasano Crypto Challenges and Rosalind are examples on where challenges you can determine in your improving journy*

## The power of believing that you can improve

#### Carol Dweck in her video talked about the schools that put the degree "not yet" instead of "failed"and how it makes people happy not that sad 
#### when they are failed, and also talked about givving challenges to kids and how they deal with the problem some of them thinking of it and some are 
#### get bored and some gone to cheating, in order it is not sutable to make a reward every time to the kids, they used a network game as a reward.

**she said about how the "not yet" gives kids a big confidence and a path to the future to think and get smarter, and thoese kids who does not use this stratigy**
**they still have a lower and lower grades, then she talked about childrens in different places have differnt levels**

**at the end she recommended that we should care about childs and consider about there mental skills and improve them.**

## The power of passion and perseverance

### Angela Lee Duckworth: tells a story of leaving her first work and starting teaching mathmatics at schools and she noticed that thier intelligence 
###are not very good, after years in teaching she conclude that teachers should learning from a motivational and psychological perspective
** then she moved and bacame a psychologist and works with psychological perspective with teachers and students and use serveys that students and thier parteners** 
** fill and make help with them to improve and build childrens.**
** finally she talked about how to grit in kids and the best way is what called called *growth mindset* which is a think of the ability of learn is not fixed**
**and it can be changed.**

## A kinder, gentler philosophy of success

** in his video Alain de Botton discussed that there crises that occured often and returnd that to the career crises and anxiety of the career,and the snobbery
** with some people that to make a small part of you to make a full vision, and another kind is job snobbery that belives the peoples are either happy or 
** making excuses and second is doesn not care about your achievements, and nowadys any person can achieve any responsiplity he want
**you can not be envious from anyone unless he has related to him or to be closed to him in age,you will not be rich and famous at one day but  you can start with small things

** there is another concept that make us feel anxious is meritocracy and it is a good thing to be in a meritocracy community, what that mean?
**if you belive that there is meritocracy community you also belive of a bottom community, in middle ages the poor person was described as unfortunate
**but nowadays described as a looser,so there is evolution in the concepts, this is a good thing if you do a good thing and if not may increases  rates of suicide
**He think of a meaning of meritocracy and of every one can  meritocrat but this is impossible because it will not be all the community at the first level or all 
**at the lowest level, but only God can put every one in his own place, so you can not judge people, there is alot of peoples who talked a wrong dissigin but you can not 
**ridicule of them, and he tells a story about how the newspaper make a ridicule of real stories.

* other thing lead to anxiety that the community were a little far from God and nature, as he said about the "success" and "failure" we all know whats the meaning
* of these concepts, beleive you will not be able to be succeded of everything but our vision is affected with the television and newspapers and now with the 
*social media so please be sure that your opinion about the success is your own opinion not affected with other thing.
