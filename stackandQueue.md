* a data structure that consists of Nodes

* Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

* any insertion or deletion will be on the top of stack 

* Stack concepts: 

    * FILO (first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack)

    * LIFO (last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack)
