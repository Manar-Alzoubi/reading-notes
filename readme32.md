* Amplify automatically creates Amazon DynamoDB database tables for GraphQL types annotated with the `@model` directive in your GraphQL schema.
* `@model` will also automatically add an id field as a primary key to the database table.
* `@model` also adds the helper fields `createdAt` and `updatedAt` to your type. The values for those fields are read-only by clients unless explicitly overwritten.
