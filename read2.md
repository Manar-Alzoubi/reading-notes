# Arrays, Loops, Imports

## Imports

Package is the same as directory and set of classes together make a package

declaration of them must be the first statments in order to use them and when we use a class of a package it search about the declaration

examples of Packages declaration:

> import javax.swing.*;
>
>import java.util.*;	
>
>import java.io.*;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Arrays 

* Array in java should declared of which type and it cant carry many types at the same time 
* declared using [] before its name
> int [] arr; // an array of name arr declared and its type is integer

* can access any element of array using its index 
> arr[1]= 5; // access the second element of array (index 1) and assign its value to 5;

* can use loops to loop through array elements and make operations on them 

>for (int i =0; i< arr.legth ; i++>)
>{
>   system.out.println (arr [i]);
>}
>
> // this loop prints all array elements

* we can declare arrays of many other types: string, char,... and it can be allocated dynamically.

## Loops

there are many types of loops in java: 

* For Loop : can excuted at least 0 times 

* While Loop: can excuted at least 0 times 

* Do-While Loop: can executed one time at least

* for-each loop : can access each element of array without using counter and number of index
